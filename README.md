# JENNER-Search for COVID-19 vaccine slot availability.

This application searches the COWIN database for available COVID-19 vaccine slots and notifies the user whenever slots are available based on certain criteria.
The project is written in java. You can run this application locally on your computer and get real time updates which are verified to be faster than notifications through third party messaging apps. Faster notifications improve your chances of booking a slot.

## Tips
To improve your chances of booking a slot, searching only one district for a single day is reccomended. This will reduce latency and give you faster notification. You may also search multiple districts for multiple dates if you wish.
